### About

Conduit is a curation tool that allows anyone to collect articles of interest from multiple feeds, make formatting changes, comments on articles on the fly then group selected items into "books" to target particular readers. The tool is set up to be a lightweight workflow tool that can support smart curation technology in order to begin to tailor suggested content.
